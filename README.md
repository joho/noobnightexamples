## Meetup Description

### Go for absolute newbies - all welcome

This month we want to run a special code along night for people knew to the go coding language. 

Some, but very little, programming experience of any language is all you need to play along.

We'll be working through 2-3 small exercises to do with accessing a weather service API and doing a couple of different things with the resultss.

Then we'll go through a demo that takes the weather API to the extreme, and follow up with some resources to take home for you to continue your learning!

Before you arrive we'll just need you to:
1. Install go from https://golang.org/doc/install
2. Install git http://git-scm.com/downloads
3. (Optional) Set up a heroku account (http://heroku.com/) and install the heroku toolbelt (https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)

We're really excited to share one of our favourite programming language and broaden our dev community - come along!

P.S. If any of the regular attendees could come to assist/pair it would be much appreciated.
